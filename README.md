# ReadMe_Generator

[Visit the ReadMe Generator!](https://kjman26.github.io/ReadMe_Generator/)

Purpose/Motivation: The purpose of this project is to create a system that creates a ReadMe by simply asking the user for a bit of input

Functionality: Answer the questions and they will create the readme

Instructions: download and install inquirer! Then open the terminal and run "node index.js" until further development allows for the program to run on init()!

Problem Solved: This solves the problem of taking a lot of time on the ReadMe section after your project is compeleted.

What I Learned: How to create a readme file using inquirer and Javascript.
